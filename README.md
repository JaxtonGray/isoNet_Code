Deep Learning Thesis - IsoNet
==============================
This repository consists of the code I used to build the deep learning neural network for my thesis. Lovingly called 'IsoNet' here and within the code for simplification. The aim of this thesis is to examine whether or not it was capalble of building an deep learning model to estimate precipitable stable water isotopes here in Canada. 

The repository consists of the main code, the data, and the results. The main code is where the model was built, the data folder contains data and data cleaning, and the results folder was post-model analysis.
